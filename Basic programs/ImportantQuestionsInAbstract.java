/* 3) Add additional code to check the following:
a) Can an abstract class/method be marked final? Why not? - no abstract class means partial desingn you should inherit the class and make override the abstract method but in final you cant make changes.

b) Can an abstract class/method be marked static? Why not? - NO, because static members means you can call directly by using class name but if the static member is abstract it depends subclasser

c) Can an abstract class inherit from another abstract class? - yes.

Should any method have to be mandatorily overridden? - depends if the inheritted class is abstract then you should overide abstract methoods in that inheritted class or rlse no need.

d) Can a concrete class be inherited by an abstract class? Test it - yes.

e) Can an abstract class have initializer/constructors? Test it - yes.
f) Can you have a private abstract method? Test it.- NO; */
