Steps to build PerformerApp:

0) Eclipse-> Core Java project -> PA
copy paste spring jar files into lib and
add them to build path.
copy paste spring.xml to src folder
1) Code POJOs (by following BPs)
2) Configure beans in spring.xml
3) Test it
	a) start spring container
	b) ask spc to hand out 
		i) inst
		ii) DIed bean objects!


What have we learnt to do using spring configurations using spring.xml
1) Ask SpC to instantiate object by using no-arg constr
2) Ask SpC to invoke param constructor and pass
simple values (primitives or strings)
3) Ask SpC to invoke param constr and
pass ref to objects
4) Ask SpC to set the properties via
setter injection for simple values
5) Ask SpC to set the property of inst
ref variable using setter injection
6) Ask SpC to inject a collection (List,Set,
array, Map) into a setter
7) Ask SpC to create a single object per
class
8) Ask SpC to create as many objs as
many times we ask of it
9) Ask SpC to invoke a method immediately
after instantiation and invoke a method
just before object is derefernced!
