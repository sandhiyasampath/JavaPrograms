What is a package in Java?

1) It is a grouping of related classes & interfaces for a) naming conflict resolution b) modularising code
c) access control
-> As a class designer,
		a) we should put all our classes inside of packages
How to declare a package?
-> package <identifier>; should be used as first line in file to make all class defn of that file belong to the package
What should be the naming convention used to name packages?
			-> use reverse domain name naming convention
			-> com.uttara.zoo;
		*Note: com.uttara.zoo & com.uttara.zoo.nonveg are 2 different package names. There are no parent-child packages in java.
	
		b) we should compile with -d option to place the .class files in the package named folder structure
	
	-> As a class user (create obj, create ref, subclass, invoke static members),
		a) if we are using classes that belong to a different package (than the one we are coding), then
			-> import the classes or
				How to import?
					-> Use 
					import <packagename>.<classname>;
						or
					import <packagename>.*;
					
			-> use fully qualified class name to refer class names.
			fqcn -> <package name>.<classname>
			
		b) if our class also belongs to the same package of the class that we are using, no need for any imports or using fqcn. But when we compile, we should use -cp option to indicate base folder
	
2) It is used as an access specifier
