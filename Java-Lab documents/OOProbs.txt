1) There are Accounts. Every Account has a number (string), owner (string) and balance (double). You can withdraw(double amt), debit(doubt amt) and
checkBalance(). When you withdraw, the balance should reduce accordingly. When you debit, the balance will increase accordingly.
Code an Account class and test it by creating 2 account objects?
How do you stop over withdrawal?

2) There are TVs. A TV has a name and channel that is being displayed. You can increment/decrement channel. You can change the channel to a given number as well. You can ask the TV to display. When a TV is asked to display, it will print the channel num, the
volume.TV has volume (int). You have to
switch on the TV first before you can operate the channels or increase or decrease the volume. Design and test TV working.

	public class TV
	{

		//members -> constr/init/methods/variables/inner classes
	

			public void changeChannel()
			{
					}
