/*20)A number is said to be made up of non-decreasing digits if all the digits to the left of
any digit is less than or equal to that digit. For example, the four-digit number 1234 is
composed of digits that are non-decreasing. Some other four-digit numbers that are
composed of non-decreasing digits are 0011, 1111, 1112, 1122, 2223. As it turns out,
there are exactly 715 four-digit numbers composed of non-decreasing digits. Notice
that leading zeroes are required: 0000, 0001, 0002 are all valid four-digit numbers with
nondecreasing digits.Find all the 715 such 4 digit numbers.*/
